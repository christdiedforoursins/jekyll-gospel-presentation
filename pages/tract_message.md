## The Gospel Message

The word Gospel translates to "Good News" and is good news indeed. The core of the Gospel message is that eternal life is a free gift from God, given to anyone who places their faith in Jesus Christ.

God requires perfect righteousness to enter Heaven, but since we all fall short of this standard due to our sin, we need a Savior. Jesus Christ, who is both fully God and fully man, lived a sinless life and died on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins. By trusting in His sacrifice on the cross, and His resurrection three days later, we receive forgiveness of sin and are guaranteed eternal life.

*“For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:.”*  
— *1 Corinthians 15:3-4*

## Our Need for Salvation

The Bible tells us that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God:

*“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;”* — *Romans 3:23*

Sin leads to condemnation, and the payment for that sin is eternal death in a place known as hell:

*“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”* — *Romans 6:23*

*“And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into.”* — *Revelation 20:14-15*

God requires sinless perfection, perfect holiness to enter heaven.

*“Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.”* — *Matthew 5:48*

We can never make it to heaven on our own merit.

*“But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.”* — *Isaiah 64:6*

*“For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.”* — *James 2:10*

## God's Plan for Salvation

Knowing we could never achieve the sinless perfection required to enter heaven on our own, God sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to live a perfect, sinless life and to die on the cross as a sacrifice for our sins.

*“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”* — *John 3:16*

Through His death and resurrection, Jesus paid the penalty for our sins and conquered death, offering salvation to all who believe in Him.

*“Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.”* — *1 Peter 2:24*

This salvation is not something we can earn through our own efforts; it is a gift of God's grace, received by faith alone.

*“For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.”* — *Ephesians 2:8-9*

When we confess Jesus as Lord and believe in our hearts that God raised Him from the dead, we are saved and made righteous before God (Romans 10:9-10). This is the good news of the gospel: that through faith in Jesus Christ, we can receive forgiveness of sins and the promise of eternal life.

## How to Receive Eternal Life

To receive eternal life and be forgiven of sins, we need to place our faith in the sacrifice Jesus Christ made on the cross. It is not about our own works, but about trusting in what Jesus has already done:

*“Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved,”* — *Acts 16:31*

When we trust in Christ, we receive the gift of eternal life:

*“And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.”* — *1 John 5:11*

Jesus Himself affirmed the certainty of eternal life for those who believe in Him, assuring us that this life is everlasting and secure:

*“Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.”* — *John 6:47*

## Eternal Security

Once you place your faith in Christ, you are secure in your salvation. God promises that nothing can separate you from His love:

*“For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”* — *Romans 8:38-39*

*“And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.”* — *John 10:28-29*

*“All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.”* — *John 6:37*

Trust Christ and you will have everlasting life, the Bible promises this.
