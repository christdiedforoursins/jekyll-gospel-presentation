# The Gospel

The word Gospel translates to "Good News" and is good news indeed. It is the message that eternal life is a free gift from God, given to anyone who places their faith in Jesus Christ. 

God requires perfect righteousness to enter Heaven, but since we all fall short of this standard due to our sin, we need a Savior. Jesus Christ, who is both fully God and fully man, lived a sinless life and died on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins. By trusting in His sacrifice on the cross, and His resurrection three days later, we receive forgiveness of sin and are guaranteed eternal life.

*“For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:.”*  
— *1 Corinthians 15:3-4*

*“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”*  
— *John 3:16*

## Our Need for Salvation

The Bible tells us that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God:

*“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;”*  
— *Romans 3:23*

Sin leads to condemnation, and the payment for that sin is eternal death in a place known as hell:

*“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”*  
— *Romans 6:23*

*“And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into.”*
— *Revelation 20:14-15*

We can never make it to heaven on our own merit.

*“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”*  
— *Romans 6:23*

## How to Receive Eternal Life

To receive eternal life and be forgiven of sins, we need to place our faith in the sacrifice Jesus Christ made on the cross. It is not about our own works, but about trusting in what Jesus has already done:

*“Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved,”*  
— *Acts 16:31*

When we trust in Christ, we receive the gift of eternal life:

*“And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.”*  
— *1 John 5:11*

## Eternal Security

Once you place your faith in Christ, you are secure in your salvation. God promises that nothing can separate you from His love:

*“For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”*  
— *Romans 8:38-39*

Trust Christ and you will have everlasting life, the Bible promises this.
